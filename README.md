# my_cross_compiler

This project is aobut how to build a GCC Cross-Compiler,
in my blog 
http://fichugh.blogspot.tw/2016/02/how-to-build-gcc-cross-compiler.html

I writed a script to test (download and build) automatically,
the thing you have to do is modified the wget-list file for the newest version of packages,
and run run_it.sh

my build time is around 10 m

just try :

$ time sh run_it.sh
